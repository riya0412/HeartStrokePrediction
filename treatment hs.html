		If you have stroke symptoms, your doctor will get a quick summary of symptoms and a medical history. You’ll likely get a CT scan of the brain. This can show bleeding in the brain and areas of the brain that may have been affected by poor blood flow. Your doctor may also order an MRI.
		<br>
		A different set of tests is done to diagnose a heart attack. Your doctor will still want to know your symptoms and medical history. After that, they’ll use an electrocardiogram to check on the health of your heart muscle.
		<br>
		A blood test is also done to check for enzymes that indicate a heart attack. Your doctor may also perform a cardiac catheterization. This test involves guiding a long, flexible tube through a blood vessel into the heart to check for blockage.

     <h1 class="hs-c">How are heart stroke treated?</h1>
     <p class="hs-p">
     	Sometimes treating the blockage responsible for a heart attack requires more than just medication and lifestyle changes. In these instances, either coronary artery bypass grafting (CAGB) or angioplasty with a stent may be necessary.
        <br>
        During a CABG, which is often referred to as “bypass surgery,” your doctor takes a blood vessel from another part of your body and attaches it to an artery that’s blocked. This reroutes blood flow around the clogged portion of the blood vessel.
        <br>
        Angioplasty is done using a catheter with a tiny balloon at its tip. Your doctor inserts a catheter into the blood vessel and inflates the balloon at the site of the blockage. The balloon squeezes the plaque against the walls of the artery to open it up for better blood flow. Oftentimes, they’ll leave a little wire mesh tube, called a stent, in place to help keep the artery open.
          <br>
          <br>
        After a heart attack and the subsequent treatment, you should participate in cardiac rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation lasts several weeks and includes monitored exercise sessions and education about diet, lifestyle, and medications for better heart health.
        <br>
        After that, you’ll need to continue exercising and eating a heart-healthy diet while avoiding things like smoking, too much alcohol, and stress.
    </p>
  
   <h1 class="hs-c">What is the outlook?</h1>
     <p class="hs-p">
     	Your outlook following a stroke or heart attack depends greatly on the severity of the event and how quickly you get treatment.
        <br>
        Some people who have a stroke will experience damage that makes walking or talking difficult for a long time. Others lose brain function that never returns. For many of those who were treated soon after symptoms began, complete recovery may be possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        Following a heart attack, you can expect to resume most of the activities you enjoyed before if you do all of the following:
        <ul class="ul">
        <li>follow your doctor’s orders</li>
        <li>participate in cardiac rehabilitation</li>
        <li>maintain a healthy lifestyle</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="hs-p">
        Your life expectancy will depend greatly on whether you adhere to heart-healthy behaviors. If you have a stroke or heart attack, it’s important to take the rehabilitation process seriously and stick with it. As challenging as it may be at times, the payoff is a much better quality of life.
     </p>


<h1 class="hs-c">Preventing heart stroke</h1>
     <p class="hs-p">
     	Many of the same strategies that can help prevent a stroke can also help reduce your chances of having a heart attack. These include:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul class="ul">
        <li>getting your cholesterol and blood pressure levels into a healthy range</li>
        <li>not smoking</li>
        <li>maintaining a healthy weight</li>
        <li>limiting your alcohol intake</li>
        <li>keeping your blood sugar under control</li>
        <li>exercising most, if not all, days of the week</li>
        <li>eating a diet that’s low in saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="hs-p">
        You can’t control certain risk factors, such as age and family health history. You can, however, live a healthy lifestyle that may help reduce your odds of having a heart stroke.
    </p>


<h1 class="hs-c">When to see a doctor</h1>
     <p class="hs-p">Get help right away if you think you're having a heart attack. Take these steps:</p>
     <ul class="ul">
     	<li><b>Call for emergency medical help. If you think you're having a heart attack, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number.</b> If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if there are no other options.</li>
     	<br>
     	<li><b>Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a health care provider.</b> Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help.</li>
     	<br>
     	<li><b>Take aspirin, if recommended.</b> Taking aspirin during a heart attack may reduce heart damage by preventing blood clotting.
     		<br>
     		<br>
            Aspirin can interact with other drugs. Don't take an aspirin unless your care provider or emergency medical personnel say to do so. Don't delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first.
     	</li>
     </ul>
