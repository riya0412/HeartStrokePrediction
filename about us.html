			<p class="content">
				Team Stroke consist of group of four college students of IPU university, we have united together to create our first industrial project on heart stroke prediction. Here we have used figma for our dashboard layout, html, css, bootstrap, javascipt for our front-end work, phython,flask and machine learning for analysing and predicting our dataset and back-end work.
				<br>
				<br>
				Our team members are:

						<li>Parmeet Kaur: Our dashboard layout designer and used figma for her work, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/MCZ5ElPxyhhs9qz7bjY4of/Dashboards-UI-Kit-(Community)?page-id=109%3A5079&node-id=111%3A5368&viewport=900%2C-976%2C1.09&scaling=scale-down">Our dashboard design</a></li>

						<li>Rameez Ansari: Front end worker and created the dashboard using html and css also contributed in the back-end work with riya. </li>
						<br>
						<li>Rashmi Gourh: Front end worker and created the website using html, css </li>
						<br>
						<li>Riya Dubey: Back end worker, used python and machine learning knowledge to analyse and predict the dataset and its accuracy to get the result.</li>

				<h2 class="sub-h">About our project</h2>
		<p class="content">
			Our Project Stroke is based on heart stroke prediction since according to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This project is based on the concept to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. This website will give you a detailed explanation regarding heart stroke, what all symptoms you will get, how it is caused and the prevention steps that you can take to stay healthy or if it is too serious then what all treatments are recommended for it. As we all know to live a healthy life you should know your risk and what all healthy lifestyle you can follow to stay fit. Our website and project can help you to build a powerful prevention plan with your health care team (doctors, nurses, pharmacists, registered dietitians, and other professionals).

		<h2 class="sub-h">Our vission for this project</h2>
		<p class="content">
			The reason why we choose this topic is because heart attacks/strokes are life-threatening medical emergencies, the quicker a person recognizes a heart attack or stroke, the better the chances of survival and a full recovery. It is important to understand the signs and symptoms of each to ensure immediate treatment and prevention. So our vission was to create a website where a person can get a detailed explanation regarding heart stroke, what all symptoms are there, how it is caused and the prevention steps that can be taken to stay healthy or if it is too serious then what all treatments are recommended for it.
			Thats why from our project we wanted to tell a person how likely he/she will get a heart stroke by predicitng it on the basis of some parameter it maybe caused. As we all know you should know your risk to live a healthy and long life.
