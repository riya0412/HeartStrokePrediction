			Leading risk factors for heart disease and stroke are high blood pressure, high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, diabetes, smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, obesity, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity.
			<br>
			<br>
			A heart stroke is caused when a coronary artery becomes blocked or narrows so much that blood flow stops or is severely restricted. A coronary artery is an artery that supplies blood to the heart muscle.

            Blockage in a coronary artery can happen if a blood clot stops blood flow. It can also happen if too much cholesterol plaque builds up in the artery to the point at which circulation slows to a trickle or stops altogether.

<h2 class="hs-p">High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol</h2>
<p class="hs-p" >
	High blood pressure is a leading cause of heart disease and stroke because it damages the lining of the arteries, making them more susceptible to the buildup of plaque, which narrows the arteries leading to the heart and brain. About 7 in 10 people who have a first heart attack and 8 in 10 people who have a first stroke have high blood pressure.Eating too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure.High LDL cholesterol can double a person’s risk of heart disease. That’s because excess cholesterol can build up in the walls of arteries and limit blood flow to a person’s heart, brain, kidneys, other organs, and legs.
	<br>
	High blood pressure strains the walls of your blood vessels. That makes them more rigid and less likely to expand as needed to maintain healthy circulation. Poor circulation can increase your risk of stroke and heart attack.


	<br>
	<br>
	People can improve their blood pressure and cholesterol levels by eating a healthy diet that is low in sodium, being physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, and taking medicines as recommended. 
</p>

<h2 class="hs-p">Diabetes</h2>
<p class="hs-p" >
	Adults with diabetes are twice as likely to have heart disease or a stroke as people who do not have diabetes. Over time, high blood sugar from diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart and block blood vessels leading to the brain, causing a stroke. More than 2 in 3 people with diabetes have high blood pressure. Diabetes also raises triglycerides and LDL cholesterol.
	<br>
	<br>
	People who have it often have high blood pressure and are more likely to be overweight. Both raise the chance of a stroke. Diabetes damages your blood vessels, which makes a stroke more likely. If you have a stroke when your blood sugar levels are high, the injury to your brain is greater.
</p>

<h2 class="hs-p">Smoking and Secondhand Smoke Exposure</h2>
<p class="hs-p" >
	Smoking is a major cause of heart disease and stroke and causes 1 in every 4 deaths from these conditions. Smoking can damage the body several ways by:
	<ul class="ul">
		<li>Raising triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood) and lowering high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, also called “good” cholesterol.</li>
		<li>Making blood sticky and more likely to clot, which can block blood flow to the heart and brain.</li>
		<li>Damaging cells that line the blood vessels.</li>
		<li>ncreasing the buildup of plaque (fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances) in blood vessels.</li>
		<li>Causing thickening and narrowing of blood vessels.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2 class="hs-p">Gender</h2>
<p class="hs-p"> Women are slightly less likely to have a stroke than men of the same age. But women have strokes at a later age, which make them less likely to recover and more likely to die as a result.</p>

<h2 class="hs-p">Obesity, Unhealthy Diet, and Physical Inactivity</h2>
<p class="hs-p">
Compared to those at a normal weight, people with overweight or obesity are at increased risk of heart disease and stroke and their risk factors, including high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, and type 2 diabetes.
<br>
<br>
A healthy diet can reduce a person’s chances of getting heart disease. A healthy diet emphasizes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and lean proteins and limits saturated and trans fat, added sugars, and sodium.
<br>
<br>
Physical inactivity can also lead to heart disease—even for people who have no other risk factors. It can increase the chance of other risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. Only 24% of adults and 16.5% of high school students meet the guidelines for aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity.
