		Heart attack or Heart stroke is caused by a blockage in blood flow to the heart. A heart stroke occurs when blood flow is impeded from reaching the heart, severely damaging the heart muscle. Most heart attacks are caused by coronary artery disease, a condition which occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries. The plaque restricts blood flow over time, which forces the heart to work harder — and can lead to damaged or failed heart muscles.The effects of a stroke depend on the part of the heart that was damaged and the amount of damage done. Knowing how your heart works can help you understand your stroke.

     	A heart stroke — or myocardial infarction (MI) — happens when a problem somewhere in the body reduces or blocks blood flow to a coronary artery.This can stop the flow of blood to the heart.Coronary arteries supply the heart muscle with blood flow. They can become narrow if substances such as fat and cholesterol build up. The name of these substances is plaque.Plaque usually builds up over several years. If pieces of plaque break off in a heart artery, a blood clot can form around it. This can stop the normal blood flow from reaching the heart muscle.If this happens, part of the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen. This part begins to die if the blockage does not receive treatment quickly.Scar tissue begins to replace healthy heart tissue. When there is damage or death to the heart muscle due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients, a heart attack can result.

<h1 class="hs-c">Conditions with similar symptoms to a heart attack</h1>

    	<ol class="ol">
    		<li>Angina: A symptom of coronary artery disease that causes chest pain or discomfort due to the heart muscle not getting enough blood. Angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in the chest area.</li>
    		<br>
           <li>Aortic aneurysm and dissection: An enlargement that can burst or tear in the aorta, the main artery in the body. This is a life-threatening emergency.</li>
           <br>
           <li>Arrhythmias: Irregular or unusually fast or slow heartbeats. These can develop into more serious medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, which can cause a stroke.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A blood clot in the lung: This can result from deep vein thrombosis, when a clot forms, often in the lower leg, and a part of it breaks off and travels to the lung. This needs emergency medical treatment.</li>
           <br>
          <li>Heartburn, acid reflux, or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD): This can also feel like a heart attack by causing severe chest pain.</li>
           <br>
          <li>Musculoskeletal pain: Sometimes damage to a muscle in the chest, neck, or arm can lead to pain that may resemble that which occurs with a heart attack.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="content">
          <br>
          <br>

         Panic disorders, anxiety, depression, and emotional stress can also cause chest pain in some people.
         <br>
         It is important to seek emergency medical treatment for chest pain to be sure it is not a heart attack or another serious medical condition.
